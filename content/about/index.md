Words change lives—the ones we think, the ones we say, the ones said to us, and the ones we write.

In college, a professor wrote seven words—“You could be a professional writer someday”—on one of my papers and changed the trajectory of my life. I transferred schools, switched majors, and decided to illuminate other people's stories by becoming a journalist. Instead, I became an editor, because priorities change lives too. More than I wanted to be a journalist, I wanted to be a mom someday, with the flexibility to be at home with my kids as much as possible, and editing seemed like the best path.

Many years and four sons later, I am both an editor and a writer, but I see that neither is confined to words on a page. I love the art of writing, but more than that, I love the art of living. 

For more than two decades as an editor, I helped uncover what authors were really trying to say, refining their thoughts and words to clarify their message. [As a coach](/coaching), I will help you uncover what your heart is saying and then provide you the tools to live it.

When I am not writing, editing, [coaching](/coaching), or speaking, I am probably hiking, reading, or spending time with my boys or friends. I love the beach, the woods, live music, and strong coffee. Also, I adore my cats.
