# ​​The Snapshot

I am a writer and a reader who is obsessed with wandering in the woods and listening to birds. Every person I meet says they tell me things they don’t tell other people. I joke that I am a walking confessional and empathy is my superpower. There is nothing I love more than understanding my own heart and helping others understand theirs. I also love strong coffee (with cream, no sugar), ridiculous memes, and snuggling with my cats. 

# The Big Picture

I have lived most of my life with alcoholics, and I am years into recovery from codependency. I’ll be living out that recovery for the rest of my life. For twenty-five years I was married to an emotionally abusive man with a hair-trigger temper who went in and out of active addiction. That marriage produced four beautiful boys and zero regret; it made me and unmade again and again until I had the courage to leave. I am who I am because of it.  

I learned afterwards that the writer’s block I experienced during my marriage wasn’t made of child raising and emotional survival. Plenty of busy parents make their living as writers, and writing often helps us survive emotionally. Instead, it was the denial I used to keep myself afloat that robbed me of my words. It’s hard to write when you’re keeping secrets from yourself.

I have left denial and secret keeping behind. When I write, when I speak, and when I coach—and every minute in-between—I tell the truth, because the truth leads us into our own hearts and takes us places we haven’t yet imagined. Vulnerability and transparency connect us and help us find our way. 

I am interested in helping people uncover the truth they’re not telling themselves and understand the ways they’re participating in their sense of powerlessness. I lived for a long time in a prison of my own making, and I want to help others see their options. The only time we’re powerless is when we believe we are.  

Mindfulness, gratitude, and joy open doors into a future you didn’t know to dream of.
