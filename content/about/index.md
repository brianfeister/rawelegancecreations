Words change lives—the ones we think, the ones we say, the ones said to us, and the ones we write.

In college, a professor wrote seven words on my final paper of the semester and changed the trajectory of my life. “You could be a professional writer someday” was all it took. I transferred schools and switched majors. I set out to illuminate other people's stories by becoming a journalist, but became an editor instead, because priorities change lives too. More than I wanted to be a journalist, I wanted to be a mom someday, with the flexibility to be at home with my kids as much as possible. Editing seemed more compatible with that goal, and it served me well.

Many years and four sons later, I am both an editor and a writer, but I see that neither is confined to words on a page. I love the art of writing, but more than that, I love the art of living. With our beliefs, hopes, and dreams, we write the story of our lives, and with our choices, we edit them. That process—the writing and the editing—goes on our whole life long. At times we may forget the power we have to write and edit, and then we may need some help—from friends and loved ones, from books, from a therapist, from a coach—to remind us. Sometimes unwelcome change comes our way and edits our lives for us, and there too, we may need some guidance, imagining how to write the pages after that, reimagining a future.

For more than two decades as an editor, I helped uncover what authors were really trying to say, refining their thoughts and words to clarify their message. [As a coach](/coaching), I am here to help you uncover what your heart is saying and then provide you the tools to live it.

When I am not writing, editing, [coaching](/coaching), or speaking, I am probably hiking, reading, or hanging with my boys or friends. I love the beach, the woods, live music, and strong coffee, preferably made with my French press. Also, I adore my cats.
