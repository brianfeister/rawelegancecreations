> My coaching experience with Danielle was phenomenal. I knew I needed forward progress in my life and accountability. But mostly, I knew I needed partnership! Someone to walk from one chapter into the next with me. Danielle didn’t lead me and tell me where to go. She didn’t walk behind me and follow me through the changes. She stood right beside me, like a friend who will love you through the hard times but also a coach who will shoot straight from the hip. I would not have made the changes and progress in my life as quickly or gracefully without her support and coaching! ~ Debi F.

> Danielle asked questions that helped me to see things in a new way. I'm aware of new possibilities as a result, and I'm moving forward in a dream that I'd put on hold. ~ Angela O.

> Danielle is a warm and inviting listener who easily builds trust. Her questions changed my perspective and helped me see opportunities in a complex situation. ~ Mandy L.
