## You have the power to write a new future.

![](stoolb-w.jpg '#position=relative;float=right;width=50%;margin=0 0 20px 20px;')

Every day you get to write the story of your life. But sometimes unexpected events come along and disrupt the narrative; other times you can forget that new chapters are possible.

When you lose the thread of your story, you may need the outside perspective a coach can bring.

For more than two decades as an editor, I helped uncover what authors were really trying to say, refining their thoughts and words to clarify their message. [As a coach](/coaching), I will help you uncover what your heart is saying and then provide you the tools to live it.

Whether you're facing a major life transition or you're feeling stuck where you are, Iâ€™m here to help you connect with your hopes and dreams, see the possibilities, and write your next pages.
