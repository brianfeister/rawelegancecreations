homequote: All of creation and your very own life are a sacred text that never
  stop speaking. The rhythms of the Earth and the arc of your story are  an open
  invitation to listen. The wisdom you need is as close as your  own heart, as
  unfailing as ocean waves.

## Life Coaching to Help You Live a Life of Joy & Purpose

Every day we are writing the story of our lives—with our beliefs, hopes, dreams, and choices. At times we forget our power to write and edit, and then we may need some help to reconnect us to the truth, and to our own hearts. 

The good news is that your past doesn’t dictate or even predict your future. It’s never too late to encounter your heart and renew your life to live with joy and purpose.

I’m a writer, editor, and life coach, and the three ways of being go hand in hand. If you’re stuck, I’m here to help you uncover your hopes and dreams, see the possibilities, and write your next pages.
