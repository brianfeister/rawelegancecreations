homequote: All of creation and your very own life are a sacred text that never
  stop speaking. The rhythms of the Earth and the arc of your story are  an open
  invitation to listen. The wisdom you need is as close as your  own heart, as
  unfailing as ocean waves.

## Do you want to live with more joy and a greater sense of purpose? 

Every day we use our beliefs, hopes, dreams, and choices to write the story of our lives. But sometimes we forget the power we hold to write and edit our own story, and then we may need some help to reconnect us to the truth, and to our own hearts. 

The good news is that your past doesn’t dictate or even predict your future. You may feel stuck now, but now is not forever. It’s never too late to encounter your heart and renew your life to live with joy and purpose.

I’m a writer, editor, and life coach, and these three vocations go hand in hand. If you’re stuck, I’m here to help you uncover your hopes and dreams, see the possibilities, and write your next pages.
