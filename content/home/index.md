homequote: All of creation and your very own life are a sacred text that never
  stop speaking. The rhythms of the Earth and the arc of your story are  an open
  invitation to listen. The wisdom you need is as close as your  own heart, as
  unfailing as ocean waves.

## You have the power to write a new future.

![](newhomepage.jpg '#position=relative;float=right;width=50%;margin=0 0 20px 20px;')

Trust me: It’s never too late to encounter your heart and renew your life to live with joy and purpose. I've done it, and you can too.

For more than two decades as an editor, I helped uncover what authors were really trying to say. [As a coach](/coaching), I will help you uncover what your heart is saying and then provide you the tools to live it.

Whether you're facing a major life transition or you're feeling stuck where you are, I’m here to help you connect with your hopes and dreams, see the possibilities, and write your next pages.
