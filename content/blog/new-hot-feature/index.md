In Praise of Fire\
by John O’Donohue\
From "To Bless the Space Between Us"\
\
I found this for Hoop Camp Fire Ceremony and read just before the Twin Firehoops Workshop\
\
Let us praise the grace & risk of fire.\
\
In the beginning\
The Word was red,\
And the Sound was Thunder,\
And the Wound in the Unseen\
Spilled forth the Red Weather of Being.\
\
[](<>)\
In the name of Fire,\
The Flame,\
And the Light:\
Praise the pure presence of Fire\
That burns from within\
Without thought of Time.\
\
The hunger of Fire has no need\
For the reliquary of the Future;\
It adores the eros of now,\
Where the memory of the Earth\
In flames that lick and drink the Air\
Is made to release\
\
Its long enduring forms\
In a powder of ashes\
Left for the wind to decipher.\
\
As air intensifies the hunger of fire,\
May the thought of death\
Breathe new urgency\
Into our love of life.\
\
As fire cleanses dross\
May the flame of passion\
Burn away what is false.\
\
As short as the time\
From Spark to Flame,\
So brief may the distance be\
Between heart and being.\
\
May we discover\
Beneath our fear\
Embers of anger\
To kindle justice.\
\
May courage\
Cause our lives to flame,\
In the name of the Fire,\
And the flame\
And the Light.\
