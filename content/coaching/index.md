**Is Coaching for You?**

![](1j1a6020.jpg '#position=relative;float=right;width=50%;margin=0 0 20px 20px;')

- Do you feel stuck—in a job, in a toxic relationship, in unhealthy habits, or in negative thought patterns?
- Do you feel powerless—in the workplace, in family dynamics, in the ability to make your life what you want it to be?
- Do you feel lost and overwhelmed—like you don't know what's next or how to make sense of where you are?
- Are you trying to envision your future after a major life transition—divorce, death of a loved one, an empty nest?
- Do you want to live with greater joy and purpose?
- Do you want to encounter your authentic self and uncover your voice and dreams?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then coaching IS for you. Gain insight. Find your power. Live with joy.
